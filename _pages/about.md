I'm a Research Scientist in the AI4Science team at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), Seattle. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) in May 2024, where I was advised by Prof. [Jian Peng](https://jianpeng.web.engr.illinois.edu/) and Prof. [Jianzhu Ma](https://majianzhu.com/). I obtained my B.E. in Automation from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2018. 

Previously, I was a short-term research scholar in [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), 
advised by Prof. [Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/), from Sept. 2018 to Feb. 2019. 
Before that, I worked in UIUC as a summer intern in 2017, advised by Prof. Jian Peng. 
In Tsinghua University, I have ever worked with Prof. [Xuegong Zhang](http://www.cssb.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/core-staff/item/142-2015-10-22-15-22-55) 
since May 2017 as a research assistant. 

My research focuses on deep learning and its applications in computational biology / chemistry. 
Specifically, my research interests lie in the intersection of geometric machine learning, generative modeling, and drug / macro-biomolecule design.
